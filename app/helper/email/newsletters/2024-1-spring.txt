**New features**
- Added [example folders](https://blot.im/examples/folders) to the documentation. These are complete sites, combining a template with posts and pages. My favorite is [Sergey](https://blot.im/examples/folders/sergey), a photography site which presents color photographs of the Russian empire from the early twentieth century. 
- You can now specify [metadata](https://blot.im/how/posts/metadata) in [Google Docs](https://blot.im/how/posts/google-docs) and [org files](https://blot.im/how/posts/org).

**Changes**
- The thumbnail generator will no longer prioritize video embeds over embedded images within the same post.
- *Slug* metadata is no longer an alias of *Link*, instead it is used as part of [your link format](https://blot.im/how/configure/link-format).  
- You can now include pages in your site's search index using [*Search* metadata](https://blot.im/how/posts/metadata#search).
- We updated Blot’s dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities and made changes to the dashboard and documentation, per tradition.

**Bugs fixed**
- Fixed [Heap analytics](https://blot.im/how/configure/analytics) integration
- Images whose filename contains punctuation can now become thumbnails
- The setting to use titlecase for your titles now works properly for titles which start with an emoji. The titlecase setting also now affects titles derived from filenames.

**Questions**
- [Is there a way to embed one text file within another one?](https://blot.im/questions/2256)
- [Email subscriptions?](https://blot.im/questions/1353)
- [What have you made with Blot?](https://blot.im/questions/1635)

**Mistakes**
- There were no major incidents this season.

**Plans for this season**
- We are considering switching the domain we use for the documentation and dashboard from *blot.im* to *blot.site*. I prefer the way *blot.site* looks and there is a security benefit to using a different domain for user-generated content. This would not affect your existing Blot subdomains. I would appreciate your thoughts – there's a part of me that believes I should simply patiently save for to purchase *blot.com*.

If you have any thoughts or questions about any of this, please don’t hesitate to reply directly to this email.

Sincerely, David
